    question: 'Where do I buy a pet?',
    answer: `Look east of the Whitestorm []. One of the shops nearby sells pets.\r\nThere's also one west of the Haven []`,
  },
  {
    question: 'What pets can I purchase?',
    answer: `Before a pet reaches level 50, you can purchase a dog, cat, monkey, or bird.
            \r\nOnce a pet reaches level 50, you can trade them for a bear, snake, elephant, or bat.`,
  },
  {
    question: 'What commands can my pet do?',
    answer: `Commands currently need reworked, but for fighting you can use 'order pet claw $*' or 'order pet rage'.
            \r\nIn addition, pets can do most actions you can do (drop, get, apply salve, eat food, etc.).`,

  {
    question: 'How do I get my pet to stop following me?',
    answer: 'Same way you would get your real pet -- order them to stay.',
  },
  {
    question: 'I left my pet somewhere, how do I get them back?',
    answer: "You can try 'recall pet'. If that doesn't work, you'll need to go to a pet store and 'claim pet'.",
  },
  {
    question: "I recalled my pet successfully, but now they won't follow me or join me in combat - what do I do?",
    answer:
      'Pets are not intelligent creatures. You have to order them to follow you after you recall them - otherwise they stay where you left them.',
