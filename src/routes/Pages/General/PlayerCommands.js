For example, 'alias gac get all from corpse' will create an alias so when ever you type 'gac' it is the same as typing 'get all from corpse'. $* is a variable. A good example of this would be 'alias nn newbie $*' this will create the alias for newbie and allow you to have a variable input each time you use it.

      'Stats (short for statistics) are several numbers for your character that represent how able you are in each category. You can see your current stats using the cost command. The following stats are available: Strength, Charisma, Constitution, Dexterity, Intelligence, Wisdom. Stats can be improved by training them at your class hall using experience. The cost is affected by several factors such as race and class and how high your stats are. Each stat is helpful for all classes, but some stats have reduced costs for each class (in order of reduced cost): Fighter - Strength, Constitution, Dexterity; Rogue - Dexterity, Charisma, Strength; Mage - Intelligence, Wisdom; Monk - Wisdom, Constitution, Dexterity, Strength; Cleric - Intelligence, Wisdom, Charisma, Strength. As you start to grow in level, stats become more and more important and you will be required to have a minimum of stats for each level.',
